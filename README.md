# Meraki Adventure API Lab

Ready to embark on this adventure of a lab? We’ll guide you through setting up Meraki’s cloud-managed solutions with the dashboard API, webhook alerts, and MV camera snapshots with real-time people detection (MV Sense), all connected together with Cisco Webex Teams and running on your own cloud services. No programming experience is needed, and just as long as you follow the steps, you’ll end up with a new set of leading edge demos that can be shown in seconds to display the power of APIs.
